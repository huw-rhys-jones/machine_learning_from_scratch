# Welcome to Machine Learning from Scratch!

## Intro

My name is Huw Rhys Jones and I completed a PhD in machine learning about a year ago. During my studies, I developed a deep understanding of the topic of practical machine learning, going right down to the very basics and all the way up to building complex neural networks. 

Since learning the basics, I went on to develop novel methods in the field of machine learning and data science and had several journal articles published. In the year and a bit since, I have moved on in my career, but I have lost touch with the practical basics. 

That's what this project is all about! If you want to learn how to make practical use of machine learning, this is the place to start!

## Source material

Whilst studying for my PhD, I kept finding myself on the same website over and over again: [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/). This website gives you a practical, hands-on guide to understanding and using machine learning techniques, from the very simple to cutting-edge methods.

## Motivation

So what's the point of this project? Can't you just follow the aforementioned website with its tutorials? Well yes, but I am hoping this project will provide a few advantages over directly using it:

1. It's a bit hard to know where to start on [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/). The tutorials there are excellent, but there's so many different topics and routes to take through. Here, I am going to try and provide a linear tutorial which blends the various areas of study.

2. I've copied a lot of the code into files within this repository. It'll save you a little bit of time.

3. The CodeSpace associated with this repository will provide a coding environment ready made.

4. I have updated a few things which appear out of date on the webiste.

Having said all that, I'll be linking directly to the website in every chapter of this project.
